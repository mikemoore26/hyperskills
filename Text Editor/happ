During the programming of this stage, you may want to slightly tweak the sizes of the components. You can do it in two ways: the first is to create an invisible border around it (this link will help), and the second is to force the component to be a certain size (this link).

Due to testing reasons, you need to set name to some components.

Set the names to these components:

JTextArea component to "TextArea"
Field which contains filename to "FilenameField"
Button that saves the file to "SaveButton"
Button that loads a file to "LoadButton"
ScrollPane to "ScrollPane"
